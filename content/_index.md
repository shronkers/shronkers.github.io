Hello! My name is Grigoriy Agasyants. I am a 16-year-old hobbyist programmer from Russia.

I'm interested mostly in low-level programming. My favorite programming languages are Rust and C.

As for foreign languages, I'm fluent in English, know a bit of French and have recently begun learning Chinese.
